It enhances the ability of language models to provide factual responses, which is a limitation of classical setups.\n\nThe goal of this project is to build a question-answering bot for movie-related questions. To achieve this, we will use RAG to provide factual information to the language model. We will upload movie descriptions to a vector database and use it to search for relevant context for the language model.\n\nWe will be using the following tools and models:\n- [OpenAI](https://openai.com)'s `gpt-3.5-turbo` model for prompt completions\n- OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model to create vector embeddings\n- [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) as the vector database to store the embeddings\n- [langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) as the tool to interact with OpenAI and Pinecone\n\nThe dataset used for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset [IMDb Movies/Shows with Descriptions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishikajohari/imdb-data-with-descriptions).","metadata":{},"id":"3e302e1c-4c18-4c44-87fd-ba935c3a0853","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Maintenance note, May 2024\n\nSince this code-along was released, the Python packages for working with the Pinecone and OpenAI APIs have changed their syntax.

Populate the vector index in Pinecone with these embeddings. Fortunately, langchain also offers assistance with this through the [`langchain.vectorstores.Pinecone`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone) helper.\n\nThese two steps can be combined using the convenient helper method `.from_document` of the `Pinecone` class. This method accepts an embedding model as input and efficiently calculates the embeddings, subsequently uploading them to Pinecone. We will also introduce some control flow to the code to ensure we do not add data to the Pinecone index if it already contains data. To achieve this, we can make use of the `.from_existing_index` method of `Pinecone`.\n\nIn addition to storing vectors, Pinecone allows the storage of additional metadata. When using the langchain helpers, it automatically assumes that vectors should be created from the `page_content` property of each `Document`.

For instance, when asked \"What's a good movie about vikings?\", the movie 'The Northman' was returned as a result.

It is crucial to always consider the data provided to the system and interpret the results of the AI system within that context. To enhance the results, one approach could be to include information about the movie quality in the movie description.\n\nThe remarkable aspect of RAG is the ability to provide relevant context to the LLM within the prompt itself.
