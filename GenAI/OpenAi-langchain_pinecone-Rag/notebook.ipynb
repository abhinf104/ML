To achieve this, we can make use of the `.from_existing_index` method of `Pinecone`.\n",

For instance, when asked \"What's a good movie about vikings?\", the movie 'The Northman' was returned as a result. It is important to note that we did not incorporate any measure of movie quality into the system, so the notion of the movie being \"good\" is not explicitly encoded in the embeddings.
